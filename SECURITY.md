# Security Policy




Include as much detail as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

We aim to respond within **5 business days** and will coordinate a fix if confirmed.

## Disclosure Policy

After a vulnerability is confirmed and resolved:
- A GitHub Security Advisory will be published
- The README and changelog will be updated accordingly

## Notes

This project is provided “as is” for research and analysis of LLM outputs. While reasonable efforts are made to avoid security flaws, it is not intended for production use without further hardening.
